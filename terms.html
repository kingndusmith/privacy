    <p>

  </p>
    <p>

And if you don't agree, you can cancel the installation and you must destroy, return or delete all copies of CollectVPN applications in your possession.
</p>
    <p>

You agree not to launch any pop-ups from our service. You agree not to attack in any way shape or form any other computer or network while on our service.
   </p>
    <p>
     Actual service coverage, speeds, locations, and quality may vary. The Service will attempt to be available at all times except for limited periods for maintenance and repair. However the Service may be subject to unavailability for a variety of factors beyond our control including emergencies, third party service failures, transmission, equipment or network problems or limitations, interference, signal strength, and may be interrupted, refused, limited, or curtailed.
  </p>
    <h3>
        Processing of your data
    </h3>
    <p>
       We are not responsible for data, messages, or pages lost, not delivered, delayed, or misdirected because of interruptions or performance issues with the Service or communications services or networks (e.g., T-1 lines or the Internet). We may impose usage or Service limits, suspend Service, or block certain kinds of usage at our sole discretion to protect users or the Service. Network speed is an estimate and is no indication of the speed at which your or the Service sends or receives data. Actual network speed will vary based on configuration, compression, network congestion, and other factors. The accuracy and timeliness of data received are not guaranteed; delays or omissions may occur.
  </p>
    <p>
Hacking, cracking, distribution of viruses, fraudulent activities, network sabotage, phishing, and/or any conduct deemed illegal or unwanted shall be subject to suspension or termination. Users are responsible for the proper secure configuration of their services and are responsible for any damages caused by their neglect or exposure of vulnerabilities whether intentional or unintentional.

  </p>
    <p>
We do not put any cap on bandwidth or data usage per user however the use of service is subjected to fair usage. Creating automated or manual VPN sessions in a manner that would impersonate a bot or exerting excessive load on the network that may disturb other users on the network or utilizing substantially excessive bandwidth that exceeds the average user bandwidth usage for an extended duration or the likes, all are considered as unfair usage of the network. We reserve the right to temporarily suspends or permanently terminate users found involved in unfair usage of its services.

CollectVPN DMCA Policy

</h3>
    <p>
CollectVPN is a service provider of transitory digital network communications under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") 17 U.S.C. p. 512(a). Accordingly, it is CollectVPN's policy to promptly terminate without notice the accounts of those determined by CollectVPN to be repeat infringers, where a repeat infringer is an end-user of the CollectVPN Services who has been notified by CollectVPN of infringing transmissions activities more than twice ("Repeat Infringer Policy"). Because of the ephemeral nature of transmissions imitated at the direction of persons using the CollectVPN Service, it is generally not possible for CollectVPN to take-down content from its system, but it will use all reasonable efforts to identify the offending persons in order to enforce its Repeat Infringer Policy.

  </p>
    <p>
Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.
